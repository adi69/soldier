Overview
========

`soldier <http://github.com/yashmehrotra/soldier>`_ is a library designed for executing and managing system processes with ease.

It is written on top of the subprocess module and has a much user-friendly API compared to subprocess.

With soldier, you can execute shell commands, get their output, status code, stderr and you can even run processes through soldier where you can set their timeouts, start them synchronously or asynchronously (and kill them whenever you want), and you can even execute root commands.
